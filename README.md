The project is a platform designed to connect donors and banks, facilitating the efficient management of donations and resources for various projects. Donors and banks can register and log in to the system, where banks can send project requests to donors, and donors can search for and accept these requests. The platform provides a donor-bank chat feature for direct communication and includes an automatic status update system to keep both parties informed about project progress. Additionally, the platform offers manual update options for situations requiring adjustments. By streamlining interactions and resource management, the system ensures that resources are allocated effectively to meet project needs.
